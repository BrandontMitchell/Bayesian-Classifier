Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
Is he gon' make it? TBD, huh
Thought I was gon' run DMC, huh
I done died and lived again on DMT, huh
See, this a type of high that won't come down
This the type of high that get you gunned down
Yeezy, Yeezy trollin' OD, huh
Turn TMZ to Smack DVD, huh
Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too

Thinkin' what if that happened to me too
Then I'm on E! News



Im living in that 21st century doin' something mean to it
Do it better then anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm trippin off the power
(21st century Schizoid Man)

The system broken, the schools closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose ma'f* we rollin',
Haaa? ma'f we rollin'
With some light skinned girls and some Kelly Rowland's
In this white man world we the one's chosen
So goodnight cruel world I see you in the mornin',
Haaa? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment.

No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm trippin off the power
Till then, f that the world's ours

f SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole a
More specifically they can kiss my a hole
I'm an a, you n got tuggs
You short minded n, thoughts is napolean
My verses mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
he knows, he so f' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My child-like creativity, purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me, taking my inner child I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrust in me
As I look down at my diamond crush to piece
thinkin..
