Nah nah nothing that don't kill me can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up man 'cos I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right man 'cos I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waitin' all night man that's how long I've been on ya
I need you right now
Let's get lost tonight you could be my black Kate Moss tonight

‘When was I ever anything but kind to him? 
But I’ll not have the fellow back,’ he said. 
‘I told him so last haying, didn’t I? 
If he left then, I said, that ended it. 
What good is he? Who else will harbor him 
At his age for the little he can do? 
What help he is there’s no depending on. 
Off he goes always when I need him most. 
He thinks he ought to earn a little pay, 
Enough at least to buy tobacco with, 
So he won’t have to beg and be beholden.
“All right,” I say, “I can’t afford to pay 
Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.”
“Someone else can.” “Then someone else will have to.”
I shouldn’t mind his bettering himself 
If that was what it was. You can be certain, 
When he begins like that, there’s someone at him 
Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,— 
In haying time, when any help is scarce. 
In winter he comes back to us. I’m done.’
